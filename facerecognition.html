									<h2>Facial Recognition</h2>
									<p>Zenitsu Cube</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									For my facial recognition, I decided to use a gif showing Zenitsu, a character from Demon Slayer. I choose one of my favorite scenes where he appears in for the cube since the cube is shown spinning, almost demonstrating the crazy and emotional persona he potrays. This character jumps from one emotion to another so I figured he was perfect for the spinning cube. This assignment was simple but very fun to explore with. I would like to try this gif with a sphere rather than a cube at a later time. (I was too shy to show my face so I used my hand instead...)
								</p>
                                <p>This assignment was particulary easy to do, especially with the very helpful tutorials provided. The only thing I struggled as I worked on this was getting the gif to appear on the cube. However, this problem was easily resolved when I realized I forgot to add the gif inside my assets folder. As soon as I fixed that tiny issue, I was able to show my gif on the cube and was satisfied with my work! </p>
