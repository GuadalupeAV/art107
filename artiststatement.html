											<h2>Artist Statement</h2>

										<p>For as long as I remember, art has always been a part of my life. As a child, my artwork would range from paintings of flowers from my home to sketches of my favorite cartoon characters. However, as I grew older, I began to gain interest in the technological portion of art. It was not until I got my first laptop during my freshman year in college when I began to practice my art more seriously. I began to explore with different programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Dreamweaver, Unity, and Processing. Since careers involving technology are rapidly growing, I figured it would be best to learn these skills in order to contribute to society in making websites and apps easier for people to use. I aspire to become a web developer one day since I enjoy making and designing websites. As an artist, I believe art comes in all forms. Art can be the way someone prefers to prepare their favorite meal or the way they dress. It can even be as simple as the way a paper bag floats into the air. In other words, art is not limited to just digital art, pictorial art, or performance art but can be part of the daily routines we do every day.  Even things we dislike is a kind of art. In my case, the art I enjoy doing that but that I also find bothersome are glitches.</p> 
<p>Ever since I was a child, I have always been fascinated with color distortion. The way the colors and patterns would intertwine with each other during a distortion on a tv screen would amuse me.I began to experiment with color distortion myself by letting wet paint drip and mix with each other on a canvas or cropping out photographs  in various angles and changing their saturation on my computer. Therefore for this portfolio, I decided to demonstrate my fascination with glitches by displaying photographs and artwork I edited using the programs Adobe Photoshop and Processing.  I still have not begun on a specific art project regarding glitches but my goal is to demonstrate to the viewers how things that are seen troublesome can be turned into something beautiful and artistic.

                                        <p>
											Most of my artwork reflects on personal experiences I have dealt with. Often times people do not speak about how they are truly feeling due to the fear or embarassment of being judged or being bothersome. I very rarely speak about my true self because of that same fear. Therefore, I feel safer expressing those feelings through art. The main color scheme of my artwork consists of pastel colors to represent hope. Lighter shade of color is often symbolized with joy and optimism, therefore I use those colors in order to demonstrate that there is hope, even when you are not feeling positive.
