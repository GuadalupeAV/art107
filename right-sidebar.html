										<p>
											For my final project, I decided to create a short animation potraying a girl feeling boredom. But when she discovers an unknown song she knows she did not added to her music playlist, little did she know she was about to enter into a different dimension. The meaning behind this animation is to potray the endless feeling of emptiness I have been feeling lately during quarantine. I usually do not have the energy to get out of my bed or do anything at all. Instead I would just lay in my bed while hearing music for hours until I manage to get the strength to get up. Music usually helps me feel recover from this feeling, especially when I happen to discover a new song. Therefore, I wanted to demonstrate how music helps me through this animation. Hopefully the viewers can find this somewhat relatable or at least enjoyable. :)
